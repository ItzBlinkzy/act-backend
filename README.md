# ACT ‚Äì AI-Driven Agentic Trading Application  

## Overview  

As part of our third-year group project, we developed an **AI-driven agentic trading application**. The system consists of a **React (Vite) frontend** and a **Go (Echo) backend**, working together to provide portfolio insights, AI-driven recommendations, and client/asset management.

## Architecture  

Our system is split into two main components:  

- **Frontend:** React + Vite (Netlify deployment)  
- **Backend:** Go + Echo (REST API, deployed separately)
